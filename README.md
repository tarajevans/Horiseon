# Code Refactor Starter Code
Horiseon Code Refactored

The assignment was to clean up all broken and messy code.  Bring code up to semantic and accessibility standards.  Fix any broken links.

I had technical issues while trying to push to github that I had both a TA and AskBCS help me with.
Not all the work I did is reflected in the repository as I had to keep copying my file into a new local repo.  I definitely did the work myself and made further changes after the push issue was resolved.
